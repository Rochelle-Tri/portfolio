                <p> The ‘Health Status Dialog’ prototype was a project where I was assigned to ideate and design a more
                    finalized version of the dialog modal that would appear on the Design System Library that shows the
                    user what technical issues the page currently has. After finalizing the design of the modal, I
                    integrated it into a high-fidelity rapid prototype of the Design System Library, to demonstrate how
                    users would interact with it and where they could find further information on the issues a page
                    could have. Since the ‘Health Status Dialog’ was a new idea that my team was in charge of bringing
                    to life, I also had the opportunity to present and explain the prototype I made to the extended
                    cross disciplinary teams of my department. </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle step-subtitle is-size-4">03 Challenges + Decisions </h2>
            <p>The most challenging part of this task was figuring out which design for the Health Status Dialog would
                work best while taking in consideration what type of info should be displayed, how users can easily find
                it, and what type of issues it should take into account. I had no knowledge on how other design
                libraries determine component issues and how they make it easier for their users to find them, so I had
                to conduct some research to understand all I needed before doing any design work. Researching and
                working with a topic I knew nothing of was a challenge that allowed me to further my understanding of UX
                design outside of what I learned in school.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially, I made numerous mockups with different layouts and my problem was that I was mainly coming up
                with different ones for the sake of just seeing which design looked and not functioned better. I was
                able to narrow down which ones worked best by learning more about elements to consider when designing
                with an empathic mindset and integrating feedback from my team into my new designs. Most of my original
                ideas during the process did not make it to the final design, but it taught me that there can be
                multiple ways to design a solution and how to efficiently design for my future UX-based projects.

            <p>Throughout every stage of this project, I either learnt something new about UX-design best practices or a
                skill such as how to do rapid-prototyping on Marvel. This project not only taught me more about how to
                design creative guidelines better, but also exposed me to prototyping platforms I had never used before,
                which allowed me to further experience learning hard skills on the spot.</p>

            <p>I spent a lot of time coming up with different designs for the Health Status Dialog just for the most
                initial design to make it to the final cut. Despite this, I would not say that the time I spent
                exploring was for waste since it allowed me to learn more about components that can be found or added in
                modals such as tabs, tooltips, and scrollbars.
