                <p> My main tasks were to ideate, wireframe, and design mockups for the guidelines and patterns pages within the
                    component library, aka a Storybook, an open source tool for building UI components and pages in
                    isolation. These pages reflected Nokia’s visual branding and philosophy while also providing
                    universal standards on design subjects such as empty states, localization, and iconography. The
                    goal of this library was to make an online source available for designers and developers to
                    easily understand and learn what Nokia’s design standards and components are, instead of reading
                    through their long text-heavy manual. </p>

            <p> Using the info from the procedures and rules that were already established in Nokia, I conducted and
                gathered more informational research on the topics I had to format for the pages. This research included
                info explaining what the topic is, things to avoid and do when using components related to the topic,
                and general best practices. Using my research, I sketched
                out potential layout ideas that displayed the topics I found most important and relevant to Nokia.

            <p>There was a steep learning curve at the beginning of my co-op term since I was not used to navigating
                through the digital design platforms and understood fairly little of the design related procedures and
                vocabulary that my team used. To get caught up on what I needed to know, I set aside a lot of time reading
                through Nokia’s own design manuals and guidelines. I also did extra research on other design systems such as
                <a href="https://spectrum.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Spectrum </a>
                and

            <p> The localization page was one of the most frustrating pages to complete because there was very little written
                on the topic from Nokia’s existing design best practices manual. I got the content I needed by asking
                questions from different designers and developers from other teams who were more knowledgeable on

                environment and etiquette quickly so that I would be able to keep up with my colleagues while also
                learning about the new material. In terms of actual design, I learned a lot of key terms and components
