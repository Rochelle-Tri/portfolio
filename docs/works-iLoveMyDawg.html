In actuality, the prototype is only a container that holds the research I did on differences and similarities on western and German design. The base of my research topic was on understanding localization in design and how design can look and function differently depending on the culture it was done for.</p>

            <p> Since my field school took place in Berlin, I knew I wanted my topic to be about German design, but I wasn’t sure what direction to go from there. After doing research, I narrowed my interests down to three main topics in my project proposal. The topic I chose was on ‘German Vs Western design’, because I was able to find the most resources to study it. Additionally, I figured that learning about this topic right now might benefit me more as a design student, as I had not learned much about design across different modern societies.

            <p>Originally, my project was going to be in the form of a research paper, but I decided to be more creative when my professor told me to explore mediums that would really show others what my field is about. Once I had my research mostly prepared, I started sketching and wireframing what my website prototypes would look like. I studied multiple veterinary services’ websites (as well as other websites I saw in my day), both German and American, to get a feel on the type of information they display on them and their design styles.

            <p>The palette for my final prototype was heavy on the blues since I found that the colour signified healthcare, trust, and reliability for the audience I was designing for. I chose brown as the secondary colour since I found that it usually compliments blue, in addition to it representing pet-like things like paw prints, mud, and fur.

            <p>What I struggled the most was making my research feel unique given all the information I learned from online sources about localization. To tackle this issue, I expanded my research methods outside of articles and books and tried interviewing German locals and my classmates (who were all Canadian) on their experience using German websites/apps compared to Western ones. My interviewees mainly consisted of students and those who are tech-savvy who are often on the internet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When given a closer look at some of the photos I chose to put on the prototype, you might realize that they are animals often used in memes. I chose these photos instead of using regular ones of animals that you would usually find on real vet websites because I wanted my project to stand out in a funny way.

            <p>
                Unlike in my design courses, I wasn’t making something serious that one would possibly use in the real world. I realized that I had more creative freedom than I thought with my final project, so I wanted to make something that would feel more special to me, while giving my classmates a laugh during our presentations on the last day of the field school.

I wasn’t very comfortable doing this form of research yet, so I hope that in the future, I am able to get better at this skill.</p>

            <p>In addition, this project taught me a lot about localization across design and content. It helped uncover some of the assumptions I made about my users and why I made them. Design can be deeply rooted in culture, which is why being educated on Germany’s history and art during my field school was so eye-opening. While I don’t think it is possible to design for everyone, I still find a lot of value in adapting design so that multiple groups can benefit from wonderful solutions.</p>
