                <p>At first glance, I Love My Dawg appears to be a website prototype for a fictional veterinary service.
                    In reality, this prototype functions as a container for my research into the differences and
                    similarities between Western (specifically North American) and German service-based website design.
                    This project explores the concept of localization in design—how visual and functional design
                    elements shift depending on the cultural context they’re created for.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle is-size-5">Research Results</h3>

                <p>
                    In summary of my research findings, I found that generally, North American service-based website
                    design tends to prioritize user-friendliness, visual appeal, and emotional engagement through bold
                    graphics and marketing-driven content. In contrast, Germans often emphasise functionality,
                    minimalism, and precision, with a utilitarian approach that ensures legitimacy and social proof.
                </p>

            <p>This project was developed during my field school in Berlin. After early-stage research and writing a
                proposal that outlined three potential directions, I chose to examine German vs. Western service-based
                website design. It was a perspective I hadn’t explored much in my coursework, and I wanted to challenge
                my assumptions about design across different modern societies.

            <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4 step-subtitle">Designing The Container</h2>
            <p>Initially, I planned to present my research as a written paper, but after feedback from my professor encouraging me to explore expressive mediums, I pivoted to a speculative website prototype. I sketched and wireframed potential layouts and conducted a comparative analysis of veterinary websites from both
                Germany and North America. This helped me understand what kind of content these services typically present, and how cultural expectations influence visual style, tone, and user flow.

            <p>I selected a blue and brown color palette—blue to convey reliability, trust, and health, and brown as a
                warm, complementary tone that subtly evokes animals (paw prints, fur, and earthiness). This helped
                ground the visual language in the veterinary theme while reflecting culturally appropriate design cues.

            <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was making my research feel unique beyond simply restating what I
                found in online articles and design blogs. To address this, I expanded my methodology beyond secondary
                sources and conducted interviews with German locals and my Canadian classmates about their personal
                experiences using German vs. Western digital platforms. Most of my interviewees were students and
                tech-savvy users, offering useful insights into usability expectations and visual norms in each region.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle is-size-5">Taking Creative Liberty</h3>
            <p>
                If you take a closer look at the imagery in the prototype, you’ll notice that many of the animals are
                internet memes rather than stock-photos. I deliberately chose these humorous photos to inject
                personality into the project. Unlike my usual coursework, this wasn’t a functional deliverable for a
                real-world client—so I used the opportunity to be playful, personal, and most importantly, make my
                presentation memorable.

                Unlike in my design courses, I wasn’t making something serious that one would possibly use in the real
                world. I realized that I had more creative freedom than I thought with my final project, so I wanted to
                make something that would feel more special to me, while giving my classmates a laugh during our
                presentations on the last day of the field school.

            <h2 class="subtitle step-subtitle is-size-4">Reflection</h2>
            <p>As my first independent research-based project, I learned how to gather and interpret information through
                multiple channels, including interviews, content audits, and observational studies. In hindsight, I wish
                I had conducted more interviews to broaden my data pool. Doing this kind of research in a foreign
                country felt intimidating at first, but it also gave me the motivation to grow in that area moving
                forward.</p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, this project taught me about localization and its deep ties to culture—not just in
                design, but in how people expect to interact with information. Studying Germany’s design history and
                visual language in context helped me recognize my own design biases and showed me how powerful it is to
                adapt design for diverse user groups.
