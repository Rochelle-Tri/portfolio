                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Rochelle (they/them)! I’m a Canadian-born Vietnamese queer designer with an interest in UX
                    research and facilitative design.
                    I graduated from Simon Fraser University’s Interactive Arts and Technology program with a BSc.,
                    where I focused my skills and education in UX/UI and speculative design. Throughout my
                    undergrad, I’ve had opportunities to conduct solo research projects and do co-ops for both public
                    and private sectors, which have allowed me to explore the intersection between design, technology,
                    and social impact. These experiences have shaped my approach as a designer who values empathy,
                    curiosity, and systems thinking—whether I'm designing for near-future scenarios or building
                    intuitive user experiences for urgent real-world applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to continue participating in work that combines sustainable, feminist-based design with
                    education to enable inclusive, accessible and enriched learning experiences for people from various
                    backgrounds. As designers, we do more than simply create products or experiences; we shape how
                    people
                    think, interact, and engage with the world. My goal is to use design not just as a tool for
                    problem-solving, but as a means of provoking new ways of thinking and fostering meaningful change. I
                    want to explore how design can be a force for societal transformation, influencing not just what
                    people use, but how they see the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my free time, I enjoy watching video essays
                    and films of any genre, diving into a new niche interest, or decompressing with yoga.
                </p>
