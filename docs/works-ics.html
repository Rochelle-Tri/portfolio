                <p>My role was to design and develop interactive eLearning content for the City of Surrey’s internal
                    Learning Management System (LMS). I was tasked with creating two interactive training modules for
                    the Surrey Fire Department: “Introduction to Incident Command System (ICS) 100” and “Emergency
                    Operations Centre
                    (EOC) Overview.” These modules were developed to introduce foundational emergency management skills
                    to exempt staff and corporate managers—many of whom had limited experience with emergency response
                    protocols. With emergency management becoming increasingly relevant across sectors like healthcare
                    and government, the goal was to provide accessible, foundational training to a broader professional
                    audience.</p>

            <p>At the start of the project, I was provided with detailed storyboards containing the course content and
                copy. My responsibility was to interpret and translate this static information into engaging,
                interactive eLearning modules using Articulate Storyline 360. To begin, I sketched layout drafts and
                annotated questions to clarify requirements or suggest content enhancements. Early in the project, I
                used Figma to prototype screens more visually before transferring them into Storyline. As I became more
                comfortable with the software, I began designing directly in Storyline, using Figma only when creating
                custom visual assets that were too time-consuming to build natively.

            <p>One of the more technically challenging aspects of the modules was designing the end-of-course quizzes.
                The Storyline update at this time offered limited customization options within quiz scenes, such as
                restricting font size in
                dropdown components. To address this, I consulted with my client and proposed simplifying and shortening
                the quiz answer text. After review, she revised the original quiz content to ensure consistency and
                legibility within the design constraints, without altering the meaning or intent of the questions.

            <p>The ICS 100 module presented another design challenge due to its longer length compared to the EOC
                Overview. Recognizing that users might take breaks or forget key information before reaching the final
                quiz, I proposed adding 1–2 mini quiz questions at the end of each chapter. This decision helped
                reinforce learning and improved knowledge retention for users unfamiliar with emergency protocols. My
                client supported this idea, and we implemented it across all chapters.

            <p> This was my first time leading a client-facing project, and it taught me how to balance independent
                design work with ongoing stakeholder communication, iteration, and usability testing. I gained hands-on
                experience with Articulate 360, and I especially enjoyed discovering custom solutions and building
                unique interactions beyond what I was initially taught. A standout moment came when my supervisor
                complimented one of my timeline solutions and mentioned it would be considered for future training
                modules.
            </p>
            <p> If given more time, I would have conducted additional user testing to further refine the module’s
                usability and learning outcomes. This project sparked a deeper interest in the intersection of design,
                education, and accessibility. It showed me how UX design can support meaningful learning experiences, and
                how education itself is a powerful tool in shaping more informed, prepared communities.
