                    solution for their client Science World, a local museum that focuses on fun exhibits that
                    make learning science-related topics easier for a young audience. To deliver a thorough and detailed design
                    pitch, my team and I were to do in depth research on the institution and its clients, identify what
                    problems could arise/that they already have, and come up with solutions through a series of
                    brainstorming and other ideation methods. </p>

                <p>The primary roles and tasks that I performed for my team included: conducting the research, creating
                    the journey maps and user personas, copywriting for the weekly design pitch decks, and group
                    management.</p>

            <p> To understand the problems our clients were experiencing, our team conducted field research online and
                at their institution. I interviewed people ranging from a variety of ages and demographics about their
                personal experiences at Science World and what they would like from them to improve on. Our initial
                framing based on our grouping exercises was that Science Worldâ€™s target audience were families with
                young children, which leaves people out of that age range feeling excluded or bored from the exhibits. I
                mainly worked on the user personas using the data based off of our final groupings and framings.

            <p>After reflecting on our past framings, we shifted our attention on how we could improve the user
                experience of adults/caregivers and their children instead of those outside of this group since they
                were not the primary audience. We decided to conduct another round of field research, this time
                narrowing it down to only children and parents. I interviewed parents and those in elementary school who
                had visited the institution in the past. Instead of focusing on what the parents wanted differently from
                Science World, I paid more attention to their own personal feelings and experiences throughout the
                institution.

            <p>Our new insights were that parents/educators often have a difficult time enjoying themselves at the
                exhibits because they are either too busy managing their children or are worried about how much they are
                actually learning. The concepts for our three products were a virtual map, a headband that tracks
                learning, and an interface that physically projects the info from an exhibit to the participant. After
                we came up with our three ideas, I was in charge of creating the journey maps, while also collaborating
                on the storyboards.</p>

            <p>My team decided to explore the idea of an interface that allows a combined engaging and learning
                experience for both the child and their caretaker. However, we still wanted a higher emphasis on the
                child as they were the primary audience of Science World and were the caretakersâ€™ main priority in
                ensuring that they have a good experience there. The solution we came up with for our problem statement
                (a lack of exhibits for families to interact together) was a mobile app that gives access to more
                optimal learning for all ages in families in order for both ages to enjoy the exhibits. On top of the
                education sector, we thought that having a feature on transportation would benefit those who are coming
                to the institution for the first time and want to maximize their time by knowing how to quickly navigate
                to the exhibits that interest them.</p>

            <p>A major challenge was how to collaborate as a team remotely since we were not able to have efficient
                meetings in the beginning. We had extremely varying work schedules and also lived in different time
                zones. To make our availability more transparent to each other, I had my group and I fill out an online
                calendar to figure out which times and days we should have our meetings. As the project progressed, I
                got a better sense of my group matesâ€™ skills and was also able to assign them different roles so that we
                could achieve our goals more efficiently. Since a member of our team had to leave the course very
                suddenly, I also took it to myself to fill in their role as the main content writer and project manager.
            </p>

            <p>The most significant changes we made were the user personas and the concepts of our user interface. In
                the beginning, our personas did not accurately portray our audience or their frustrations and we did not
                do a good job showcasing them in our design pitch. After seeking feedback and conducting more research, I
                understood that while explaining our personas, I had to provide evidence from our data to make them
                appear more credible and realistic.</p>

            <p> Emphasizing with the audience that I was designing for was more difficult than I thought. I learnt that it required very deep reflection and analysis to understand
                what potential problems/frustrations they could have and that I should not make assumptions about them.
            </p>

            <p>Since this was my first major user experience design project, I learned much on the topic and greatly
                developed my leadership and communication skills through the challenges I faced. Due to the heavy
                expectations on each design pitch every week, I was able to better develop my time management and
                problem solving skills using the given feedback from every critique. This project allowed me to learn
                how to quickly adapt to stressful situations and understand when to take direction in a project. In the
                end, I felt that I was able to successfully do my part and not only greatly improved the user personas
                and final pitch but also managed my team in the most accommodating way possible.</p>
