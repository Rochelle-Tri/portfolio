            <p>To better understand the challenges faced by Science World’s visitors, our team conducted both online and on-site field research. I interviewed individuals from a wide range of ages and demographics to gather insights into their personal experiences at the institution and areas they felt could be improved. Based on our affinity mapping and grouping exercises, we initially framed Science World’s primary audience as families with young children, which suggested that visitors outside this age range might feel excluded or disengaged by certain exhibits. I primarily focused on developing user personas, using insights drawn from our finalized research groupings and problem framings.

            <h3 class="subtitle is-size-5">Reframing</h3>
            <p>After reflecting on our earlier framings, we shifted our focus toward improving the shared experience of children and their caregivers, rather than addressing audiences outside this group, as they are Science World’s primary visitors. We conducted a second round of field research, narrowing our scope to parents and elementary-aged children who had previously visited the institution. During these interviews, I moved beyond asking what parents wanted to change and instead focused on understanding their personal emotions, perceptions, and experiences throughout their visit.</p>

            <p>Our team explored the idea of designing an interface that offers an engaging and educational experience for both children and their caretakers. While inclusivity was important, we placed greater emphasis on the child, as they are Science World’s primary audience and the caretaker’s main priority when visiting. To address our problem statement, the lack of exhibits that encourage family interaction, we proposed a mobile app that enhances learning opportunities for families of all ages, allowing both children and caretakers to enjoy the exhibits together. In addition to its educational features, the app includes transportation and navigation tools to support first-time visitors, helping them efficiently find and explore exhibits that match their interests and maximize their time at the institution.</p>

I also refined the journey maps, collaborated on the wireframes, and brought together the final copy of the user flowchart after the drafts from each member were made.

            <p>A major challenge we faced was collaborating effectively as a remote team, particularly at the start of the project. Our differing work schedules and time zones made it difficult to coordinate efficient meetings. As the project progressed, I developed a stronger understanding of my teammates’ individual strengths, which allowed me to assign roles more strategically and improve our overall efficiency. When one team member unexpectedly withdrew from the course, I stepped in to assume their responsibilities, taking on the roles of primary content writer and project manager.
            </p>

            <p>The most significant revisions we made involved our user personas and the overall direction of our user interface concepts. Initially, our personas did not accurately represent our target audience or their key frustrations, and this weakness was reflected in our design pitch. After gathering feedback and conducting further research, I realized the importance of supporting our personas with concrete evidence from our data. This approach helped make them more credible, realistic, and compelling within our design narrative.

            <h2 class="subtitle step-subtitle is-size-4">Learning Outcome</h2>
            <p> As a second-year design student, I found that empathizing with a target audience was more challenging than I initially expected. I learned that meaningful empathy requires deep reflection and careful analysis to truly understand users’ potential frustrations, rather than making assumptions based on surface-level observations.
            </p>
            <p> As this was my first major user experience design project, I gained valuable knowledge in UX principles while significantly strengthening my leadership and communication skills through the challenges I encountered. The high expectations and weekly design pitches pushed me to improve my time management and problem-solving abilities by applying feedback from each critique. This project taught me how to adapt quickly in high-stakes situations and recognize when to take direction within a collaborative process. Ultimately, I believe I contributed effectively to the project by enhancing the user personas and final pitch, while managing my team in a supportive and accommodating manner.
