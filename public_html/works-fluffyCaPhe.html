                <p> Fluffy Cà Phê (coffee in Vietnamese) was a school group project in my web design and development course. My partner Jason and I were to design and develop a website for a made-up company, in which we chose to do a local cafe that specialises in Vietnamese style coffee and French desserts.. Our website features information about the cafe, what services they offer and how to purchase them, their location and running times, and how to contact them. It was also designed to be used on all types of devices.</p>

            <p> Both Jason and I were involved in the process of ideating what our website would look like and coding it together. Since I had more experience with UX design and Jason with coding, I decided to make more design-related decisions throughout this project.
            </p>

            <p>I first started with sketching out potential layouts for half of the pages for the website (Jason was in charge of doing the other half). Afterwards, I made low-fidelity wireframes of my sketches on Figma, and compared them with the ones that Jason made. We exchanged our ideas on the layouts of the different pages and the user flow before deciding on one set of wireframes that would serve as the basis for the design of the site. </p>

            <p> We created a style guide together, which we did research from other style guides and websites of various cafes to find inspiration. Some of the local cafes we took inspiration from were La Foret, D’oro Gelato e Caffè, and Pallet Coffee Roasters. For the most part, I was also in charge of writing the content on the page and finding images that suited our theme and brand.

            <p> During the website’s coding process, I handled coding the skeleton in HTML for most of the pages while Jason oversaw adding the CSS and debugging. Even though I was not as skilled in coding as my partner, I still pushed myself to attempt styling some of the elements in my assigned pages and tried learning through Jason’s own code. To ensure our website was accessible and did not have any errors, we ran our pages through code validators and tested it on different platforms and screen sizes.

            <p>The colour palette we decided on were light orange, blue, brown shades, since they looked complementary and  I believed it best suited the mood of a cozy cafe and bakery. When re-assessing what our main goals were for this website (providing a source for the cafe’s customers to see and buy our products), I made sure to add other ways users can navigate to the products page aside from the main navigation bar.
            </p>

            <p>Near the end of this project, I also frequently checked if the interaction cues for all of the interactable components were visible enough and that the forms all gave appropriate feedback, which I made styling changes accordingly.

            <p>Some of the issues we ran into while coding the site was getting our site to be functional and responsive when turning off Javascript and making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices. While testing the site, I noticed that our navigation bar did not follow our intended design layout when Javascript was off since we didn’t take that factor into consideration. I consulted this issue with my partner before we decided on how to change some of the code to make the site usable without Javascript, which we referenced mainly from online sources.
