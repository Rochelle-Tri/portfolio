                <p>As an Educational Designer co-op for the City of Surrey, my role was to design and develop interactive eLearning content for Surrey’s Learning Management System. I was tasked to create two interactive modules for my client from the Fire department. These modules were called “Incident Command System (ICS) 100” and “Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Overview”.</p>

                <p>The goal of these modules was to provide training on how to run an emergency since the skills are becoming more in demand in various faculties such as hospitals. I was generally targeting exempt staff and managers in corporate positions who were not experts on the topic of emergencies and needed the basic knowledge.</p>

                <p>Due to city of Surrey's copyright rules, please contact me for the link to view the entire learning modules.</p>

            <p>At the start of the project, I was given storyboards that had all the copywriting for the eLearning courses. My job was to understand the content and structure of the course in order to extract its info and turn it into an interactive module. Before jumping on Storyline 360, which was the software I used to build the modules, I sketched out layout drafts and made notes on what type of content I needed or questions I had to ask my client. Closer to the beginning to the term I would take my sketched drafts to Figma to further visualize my ideas. As I got used to using Storyline, I started just designing my layouts directly after sketching them. However, I still used Figma to create certain assets that were too tedious to do on Storyline.

            <p>Since my project was very long-term, I was responsible for setting up my own deadlines for each stage of the process to ensure that I would not fall behind schedule. To do this, I arranged online meetings with my client to go over the process of each eLearning module and to show my progress so that I could gather feedback and ask questions. I was also able to get user feedback from my team throughout multiple iterations since I was able to upload my draft modules online (Review 360) for them to view, test out, and provide comments. </p>

            <p>One of the more difficult parts I designed in the modules were the quizzes that would appear at the end of course. Storyline had more restrictions when it came to designing the individual components in the quiz slides than the regular slides. For example, I was not able to change the font size of the text on the drop-down component when implementing the answers on the slide. To work around this, I checked in with my client first if I could change the text since it was not part of my duties to alter any of the given written content. After our discussion, we decided that  the best option was for her to rewrite most of the original answers from the pre-written quiz so that it would be more concise and similar in length in order to fit and be legible in the drop-down component.

            <p>Compared to the length of the EOC module, the ICS module was a lot lengthier, thus had a longer quiz. After doing multiple runs through the module myself, I knew that due to its length, there was a chance that the people taking it would take breaks when finishing certain sections. If they were learning most of the content for the first time, they would most likely not be able to memorise it all in time for the quiz either. My client and I came to an agreement that we would add 1-2 mini quiz questions at the end of each section to test the user on the content within it. The aim was to give refreshers on the most important points on every chapter to help prepare them for the final quiz.

I gained a lot of insight and experience on balancing design work with client meetings and user testing as I was in charge of designing and ensuring the usabilty of my project on my own. Using and learning Articulate 360 was very interesting and fun since it allowed me to come up with personal ways of building interactions and components that were different from how my supervisor initially taught me. </p>
